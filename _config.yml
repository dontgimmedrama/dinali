      Since 2021, I've been roaming between Europe, Asia, and Australia, using to the fullest ability to work remotely. When I'm not working, I love to take time for myself by practising meditation, yoga and reading books. I am also a big foodie, always on the lookout for new and exciting culinary experiences. Whether it's trying a new recipe, or discovering a hidden gem of a restaurant, food is always on my mind. I believe that a healthy balance of work and play is essential for a fulfilling life, and I strive to incorporate this into my daily routine.
